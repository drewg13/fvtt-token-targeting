# Token Targeting

## Known Issues
Syncing between users seems to take a few cycles to work properly.  Deselecting and reselecting the Token seems to help.  Working on it.

## Usage
To use, activate in the Manage Modules window.

Once active, you can turn it on and off via the setting in Configure Settings -> Module Settings.

Targets set by one user will be shared with all other users who control that token.

An additional setting restricts the behavior to GMs only, if preferred.  In this case, non-GM users will ignore targets set by GM users.


## Functions
This module stores targeting data in Token Document flags so that, when you change your controlled Token, the flags are read and your User targeting data is changed to the current token's targets.
